# Appendices:

### 1. About the Name 'Plutus':

Plutus, in ancient Greek religion, represents the god of abundance and wealth. Naming our project "Plutus" is symbolic, drawing from this deity to represent the prosperity and trust we aspire to infuse into personal lending in Kenya.


### 2. Potential Competition:

While there is a notable surge in fintech platforms in regions like Africa, platforms specifically tailored for tracking and formalizing personal debts among friends and family are not prevalent. Platforms like M-Pesa play a significant role in the Kenyan financial ecosystem, they focus on transactions rather than formalizing and monitoring personal debts.
